+ The departments with the most eligible mentors are senior staff, engineer, and staff. These departments still account for less than 5% of the staff is expected to leave in their respected departments. 


### Summary
+ It is estimated that 72,458 roles will need to be filled. This is going to have the largest impact in the senior engineers and senior staff positions. Additionally, the number of eligible mentors for the senior engineering department doesn’t account for 1% of the number of the estimated senior staff department approaching retirement age. 
 

+ The correct mentor to trainee ratio will depend on the mentor to employee ratio that is preferred. However, the average mentor to trainee proportion is 2%. Meaning each mentor would have approximately 50 trainees. However, proportions vary between departments with the technique leader department at a 6% mentor to trainee proportion, giving each mentor around 20 trainees. On the other side, the manager department has a 0% mentor to trainee rate meaning there are no mentors for the trainees.
